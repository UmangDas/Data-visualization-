# Data Visualization in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates data visualization techniques using the Matplotlib library in Python. It includes creating bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms using data from a Pandas DataFrame. The visualizations are customized with labels, titles, and legends to enhance clarity.

## Project Details

### Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For handling and manipulating datasets.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For statistical visualizations.
- **datetime**: For handling date/time data.

### Key Operations
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualizing relationships between `year` and `own`.
- **Line Chart**: Showing trends over time for `year` and `own`.
- **Bar Chart**: Comparing values of `year` and `own`.
- **Histogram**: Displaying the distribution of `income`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd data-visualization
   ```

3. Run the Python script to execute the data visualization tasks.

   ```bash
   python visualization.py
   ```

### Example Functionality
After executing the script, various charts will be displayed, including scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, and histograms. You can modify the script to customize the visualizations according to your data needs.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic foundation for data visualization in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Understanding these techniques will help you effectively present and analyze data for insights.
